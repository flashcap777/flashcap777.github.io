# Projects
## Bail Out: Battery Fighter
Bail Out: Battery Fighter is 2D platformer I'm currently developing for PC. The main mechanic is a dash, which can counter enemy attacks, and resets on contact with the ground.

## AP Computer Science Principles Create/Performance Task
For my Create/Performance Task, I made a randomly generated Dungeon Crawler. The main feature is an algorithm to sort binary strings into level layouts that would maintain paths and openings, and then convert them into solid tiles of rocks. This game features a working health system, enemies, a score system, and for all purposes of demonstration, is 100% complete. This project was created with a week of class time as per the AP curriculum.

## Sonic The Hedgehog Engine Recreation
Using data from [the Sonic Physics Guide](http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide) on SonicRetro.org, I accurately recreated the physics engine from the Sonic The Hedgehog Genesis/MegaDrive games. This is a short demonstration of the engine, showing movement mechanics, paralax scrolling, and enemy AI.
