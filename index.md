# Projects
## Bail Out: Battery Fighter
Bail Out: Battery Fighter is 2D platformer I'm currently developing for PC. The main mechanic is a dash, which can counter enemy attacks, and resets on contact with the ground.

- This is the latest version of the game showcasing a test level, however, many assets are still placeholders.

- This is the earliest recorded version of the game showcasing the physics engine, which was slightly revised in later versions. 

## AP Computer Science Principles Create/Performance Task
For my Create/Performance Task, I made a randomly generated Dungeon Crawler. The main feature is an algorithm to sort binary strings into level layouts that would maintain paths and openings, and then convert them into solid tiles of rocks. This game features a working health system, enemies, a score system, and for all purposes of demonstration, is 100% complete. This project was created with a week of class time as per the AP curriculum.

## Sonic The Hedgehog Engine Recreation
Using data from [the Sonic Physics Guide](http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide) on SonicRetro.org, I accurately recreated the physics engine from the Sonic The Hedgehog Genesis/MegaDrive games. This is a short demonstration of the engine, showing movement mechanics, paralax scrolling, and enemy AI.

# Music
## FamiTracker
FamiTracker is an NES soundchip emulator which can be used to program songs that can run on real NES hardware.
Using this, I taught myself how to compose music, and later created soundtracks for many of my projects.

### Bail Out: Battery Fighter OST - First Contact
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XgdGJK-g-EqZeIzLwgZrOVm-XhduOefn/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
- This is one of the final boss themes in Bail Out: BF (ironically titled "First Contact") where the main enemy is an intergalactic horror that has appeared before the protagonist. In the intro, I used more obscure chords and intervals in establishing a motif, to represent the unnatural nature of the alien menace. The motif then appears again, now with more common intervals to represent the hero's successful analysis of his enemy's abilities. He then finds courage in the end, where the key changes a third time to fill the player with determination.

### Bail Out: Battery Fighter OST - High Alert
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14NTeuxchqWJ1UUwt8KzdK9CgWEfBHXH7/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
- This is one of the last level themes in Bail Out: BF, where the player has to escape the area after tripping an alarm system, (aptly named, "High Alert"). I took more inspiration from rock and roll songs in making this theme. 

### Super Dragon Vanguard! OST - The Vanguard Basilisks [Stage 5]
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SIi2zWBuLMJ3powJR-nHAAgySpZIO0N8/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
- This is a song created for a conceptual game about Dragons and Arkanoid that I came up with. My friend helped me compose the opening melody, which I transcribed into FamiTracker, and completed.

### Super Dragon Vanguard! OST - Attack On Colossus [Boss Theme]
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYgppMm9uGXWiJQf0iFHQXzVvUZDORfZ/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
This is another song created for SDV, this time, a Boss theme.

## Non-NES Soundtracks

### Miradyssey OST - Battle Theme
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio/Miradyssey Battle Theme v2.ogg" type="audio/ogg">

- This song is the main battle theme for my first 3D Project, Miradyssey, an RTS-JRPG which is also in development. This project is where the low poly protagonist originates. I wanted to make it sound reminiscent of older RPG battle themes in the beginning, but quickly diverge it into something more unique and memorable. 

### Miradyssey OST - Venomworks Construct
<audio controls>
   <source src="audio/Venomworks Construct.ogg" type="audio/ogg">

- This song is one of the main dungeon themes for Miradyssey, "Venomworks Construct." I used various chiptune samples and more digital-sounding instruments to represent the nature of the enemies in this area; the Lunyoro, a group of technologically advanced gravity bending snakes (who are probably more terrifying than snakes restricted to the ground).

### Unused OST - Walls of The Quartz Castle

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio/Walls of The Quartz Castle.ogg" type="audio/ogg">

</audio>
- This song is not used in any of my current projects, but I wanted to make it to experiment with the Pokemon soundfont, which this track features heavily. The name was chosen after the song was long completed, because it made me imagine a hero scaling a castle of quartz, gaining hope throughout the piece has he faces many challenges, puzzles, and enemies.
